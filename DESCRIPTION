Description: A Bayesian meta-analysis method for studying cross-phenotype
    genetic associations. It uses summary-level data across multiple phenotypes to
    simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association
    and estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk locus. CPBayes
    is based on a spike and slab prior.
